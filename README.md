# Comparing AirPublic sensor data with LAQN

Below one can explore the data from our first field trial. We placed our small AirPublic sensor next to the large London Air Quality Network container in Marylebone. The sensors seem to correlate quite well. 

You are welcome to play more with the data in the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/airpublic/climathon2016/blob/master/Comparing%20AirPublic%20sensor%20with%20London%20Air%20Quality%20Network.ipynb).
